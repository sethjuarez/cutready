# CutReady — Copilot Project Instructions

## What Is CutReady

CutReady is a **desktop application** for product demo video production. Users create structured demo plans (sketches) with planning tables and reference screenshots, optionally record a rough demo walkthrough, then an AI agent refines it into a production-ready script. Automation replays the polished demo while the user reads a teleprompter. Output is an organized folder with lossless video, clean audio, and an FCPXML timeline ready for DaVinci Resolve.

## Core Philosophy

- **Sketch-first**: The primary entry point is authoring a structured plan (sketch) with sections, planning tables, screenshots, and optional visuals. The sketch guides the recording and evolves through the workflow.
- **Record-first (alternative)**: Users can jump straight into recording without a sketch.
- **Agentic refinement**: AI cleans accidental clicks, stabilizes selectors, drafts narration, estimates timing, suggests animations, and generates framing visuals.
- **Self-healing replay**: When UI changes break a replay action, the agent auto-heals the selector.
- **Edit-ready output**: FCPXML 1.9 timeline with video, narration, system audio, and animations on separate tracks.

## Data Model

CutReady uses a **Storyboard → Sketch** hierarchy:

- **Sketch** (`.sk` files): A scene with title, description, and a planning table. Each planning table row has: Time, Narrative, Actions, Screenshot, and an optional Visual (Elucim DSL JSON stored externally in `.cutready/visuals/`).
- **Storyboard** (`.sb` files): Sequences sketches with optional named sections. References sketches by path.
- **Notes** (`.md` files): Markdown documents for planning, context, and AI-generated content.
- **Sessions** (`.chats/` directory): Saved AI chat sessions with full message history.

## Project Storage

Projects are **portable folders**. A CutReady project IS a user-chosen folder:

```text
my-demo-project/
├── intro.sk                    # Sketch files (JSON)
├── setup-walkthrough.sk
├── demo-storyboard.sb          # Storyboard files (JSON)
├── planning-notes.md           # Markdown notes
├── screenshots/                # Captured screenshots (PNG/JPEG)
├── .cutready/                  # CutReady metadata
│   ├── visuals/                # Elucim DSL visual JSON files
│   └── settings.json           # Per-project settings
├── .chats/                     # Saved AI chat sessions
└── .git/                       # Git versioning (managed by gix)
```

- No central project registry — projects are opened by folder path.
- Recent projects stored via `tauri-plugin-store` in app data.
- All user-provided relative paths go through `project::safe_resolve()` to prevent path traversal.

## Design Decisions

- **Frameless window**: `decorations: false` with custom TitleBar (drag region + window controls).
- **VS Code-inspired layout**: Activity bar → primary sidebar → editor area → secondary panel.
- **Theme**: CSS custom properties in `:root` / `.dark`, toggled by `.dark` class on `<html>`. Three modes: light, dark, system. Persisted in `localStorage` key `cutready-theme`.
- **Color palette**: Warm, soft tones (not cold zinc). Dark: warm browns (#2b2926). Light: warm off-whites (#faf9f7).
- **Color architecture**: All colors flow through CSS variables. Components use `var(--color-*)` or Tailwind tokens — never hardcoded color classes.
- **Accent color**: Soft purple/violet (light: #6b5ce7, dark: #a49afa). Purple is the brand color.
- **Font**: Geist Sans via `@fontsource/geist-sans` (400, 500, 600). Letter-spacing: -0.011em.
- **IPC**: Tauri Commands for request/response, Channels for streaming, Events for broadcasts.
- **Events over polling**: Prefer event-driven patterns (callbacks, `visibilitychange`, Tauri events) over `setInterval`/`setTimeout` polling. Polling timers prevent Windows from sleeping and waste CPU. When polling is unavoidable (e.g., no push mechanism exists), gate the interval on `document.visibilitychange` so it pauses when the app is minimized or the screen is locked.
- **Headless processes**: ALL subprocess spawns (`Command::new`) on Windows MUST include `creation_flags(0x08000000)` (`CREATE_NO_WINDOW`) to prevent console windows from flashing. This applies to CutReady's own code AND any SDK/library forks we maintain. Wrap the flag in `#[cfg(target_os = "windows")]` for cross-platform compatibility.
- **LLM routing**: Auto-routes codex/pro models to Responses API, others to Chat Completions. Detection in `llm.rs`.
- **Path safety**: All user-provided paths go through `safe_resolve()` before filesystem access.
- **Web shim**: `devMock.ts` activated when `import.meta.env.DEV && !__TAURI_INTERNALS__`. Enables Playwright E2E testing and browser development without the Tauri shell.
- **Command palette**: Ctrl+Shift+P — commands registered via `commandRegistry.registerMany()` in AppLayout.

## Shared Agentive Crate

The LLM engine (`src-tauri/src/engine/agent/llm.rs` + `runner.rs`) should be migrated to use the shared **agentive** crate at `D:\projects\agentive` (GitHub: `sethjuarez/agentive`).

### What agentive provides

- `Provider` trait with `OpenAiProvider`, `AnthropicProvider`, `ResponsesProvider`
- `AuthStrategy` enum — `ApiKey`, `Bearer`, `Dynamic(Arc<dyn Fn() -> String>)` for Entra/Foundry tokens
- `run()` agentic loop with streaming, tool execution, retries, cancellation, guardrails, steering
- Core types: `ChatMessage`, `ToolCall`, `ToolResult`, `ChatEvent`, `Usage`
- SSE parser hardened against UTF-8 edge cases
- Context window trimming
- 117 tests including live integration against OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and Anthropic

### Migration plan

1. Add `agentive` as a git dependency in `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
2. Replace `LlmClient` / `LlmProvider` with agentive's `OpenAiProvider` / `ResponsesProvider`
3. Replace local chat/message/tool types with `agentive::types::*`
4. Replace the custom runner loop with agentive's `run()` + `RunnerEvent` stream
5. Wire `AuthStrategy::Dynamic` with the existing `azure_auth.rs` token refresh
6. Keep `azure_auth.rs` — OAuth/PKCE/device-code flows are app-specific UX
7. Keep `tools.rs` — sketch/storyboard/web tools are app-specific
8. Keep `web.rs` — web fetch tool implementation
9. Map agentive `RunnerEvent` to existing `AgentEvent` for Tauri channel streaming

### What stays app-specific

- `azure_auth.rs` — Entra OAuth UX (browser flow, device code, token refresh)
- `tools.rs` — domain tools (read/write sketches, web fetch, visuals, image encoding)
- `web.rs` — web page fetching for agent tools
- `runner.rs` agent orchestration (Planner/Writer/Editor/Designer routing) — may wrap agentive's `run()`
- `engine/memory.rs` — agent memory system (core, procedural, archival)

## Testing & Validation

- **Build**: `npm run build` (tsc + vite)
- **TypeScript check**: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- **Rust tests**: `cd src-tauri && cargo test`
- **Vitest**: `npx vitest run`
- **E2E tests**: `npx playwright test` (uses web shim, no Tauri needed)
- **Web dev mode**: `npx vite --port 1420` (runs frontend in browser with devMock backend)
- **Docs site**: `cd docs && npm run build`

## Keeping Instructions Current

These instruction files are living documents. **When you notice a pattern repeating** — the user correcting the same mistake, re-explaining a convention, or a new architectural decision becoming established — **update the relevant instruction file and commit the change.** Don't wait for an explicit ask.

Signs an instruction update is needed:

- User corrects the same thing twice (e.g., "don't use that color", "use icons not text buttons").
- A new convention emerges from implementation (e.g., a new data model, a new IPC pattern).
- A section says "planned" or "placeholder" but the feature is now implemented.
- The project structure listing is missing files/modules that exist.

When updating, also use `store_memory` to capture the convention for cross-session recall.
