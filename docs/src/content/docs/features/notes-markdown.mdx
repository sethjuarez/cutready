CutReady includes a **Markdown Notes** feature for keeping free-form project
documentation alongside your sketches and storyboards.

## Markdown Editor

Notes use a **CodeMirror**-based editor with:

- Full markdown syntax highlighting
- Inline code and code block support
- Heading, list, and emphasis formatting
- Auto-save — changes are saved automatically as you type

## Use Cases

- **Demo scripts** — Full narrative text before breaking it into table rows
- **Setup notes** — Document environment prerequisites for your demo
- **Meeting notes** — Capture feedback from demo reviews
- **Research** — Links, API docs, and reference material

## Creating Notes

1. Click the **+** button in the storyboard list
2. Select **Note**
3. Start typing in the markdown editor

Notes appear alongside sketches and storyboards in the sidebar and can be
reordered with drag-and-drop.

## Storage

Notes are stored as `.md` files in the project's `notes/` directory and are
included in the project's version history.
