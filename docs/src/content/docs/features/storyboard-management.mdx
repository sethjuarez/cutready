A **storyboard** is an ordered sequence of sketches that forms a complete demo
flow. While a sketch is a single scene (one planning table with narrative,
actions, and screenshots), a storyboard chains multiple sketches together into
a cohesive presentation.

## Sketches vs. Storyboards

Think of it like a movie:

| | **Sketch** | **Storyboard** |
|---|---|---|
| **What it is** | A single scene | A sequence of scenes |
| **Contains** | Title + planning table (time, narrative, actions, screenshots) | Title + ordered list of sketch references + sections |
| **File** | `.sk` | `.sb` |
| **Purpose** | Plan one segment of a demo | Organize an entire demo flow |
| **Editing** | Full inline editing of table rows | References sketches — click through to edit |

A sketch is the **building block**. A storyboard is the **assembly**.

## Storyboard Structure

A storyboard contains an ordered list of **items**, which can be:

- **Sketch references** — pointers to `.sk` files in your project
- **Sections** — named groups that organize sketches under headers

```
Product Launch Demo (storyboard)
├── intro.sk                         ← sketch reference
├── Getting Started (section)
│   ├── install-setup.sk
│   └── first-run.sk
├── Core Features (section)
│   ├── dashboard-tour.sk
│   └── api-walkthrough.sk
└── closing-cta.sk                   ← sketch reference
```

Sketches can exist independently or be referenced by multiple storyboards.
Deleting a sketch that's referenced by a storyboard will show a warning.

## Creating a Storyboard

1. Click the **+** button in the sidebar
2. Select **Storyboard**
3. Give it a title (e.g., "Q1 Product Demo")
4. The storyboard editor opens with an empty canvas

## Adding Sketches

From the storyboard editor:

- **"+ New Sketch"** — Creates a blank sketch and adds it to the storyboard
- **"+ Add Existing"** — Opens a searchable picker to select from your sketch library
- Insert buttons appear **between** sketches for precise positioning

## Organizing

- **Drag and drop** sketches to reorder them within the storyboard
- **Add sections** to group related sketches under named headers
- **Collapse/expand** individual sketches to show or hide their planning tables
- Each sketch card shows its title, lifecycle state badge, and row count

## Preview Mode

Click **Preview** to launch a fullscreen presentation built from the storyboard:

1. Select which monitor to present on (multi-monitor support)
2. CutReady builds a slide deck: storyboard title → each sketch's title + planning rows
3. Navigate through the presentation to review the full demo flow

<Aside type="tip">
  Storyboards reference sketches by file path. You can reorganize your sketches 
  freely — just keep them in the project folder so the references stay valid.

## The Sidebar

The **Storyboard List** sidebar shows all project documents together:

| Document Type | Icon | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Sketch** | ✏️ | Individual planning scenes |
| **Storyboard** | 📋 | Sequences of sketches |
| **Note** | 📝 | Free-form markdown documents |

Sidebar features:
- **Drag and drop** to reorder the list
- **Search** to filter by name
- **File tree view** as an alternate navigation mode
- **Context menu** (right-click) for rename, delete, and other actions
- Order is persisted in a `.manifest` file

## Tabbed Editing

Opening any document adds it as a tab. You can have multiple tabs open:

- Document name and type icon
- Dirty/unsaved state indicator (dot)
- Close button on each tab
