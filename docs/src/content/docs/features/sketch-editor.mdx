The Sketch Editor is where you plan your demo before recording anything. It
provides a structured 4-column table for scripting your walkthrough, along with
a title, description, and integrated screenshot capture.

## Planning Table

Each sketch contains a planning table with drag-and-drop reorderable rows.
Every row has four columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Time** | Target timing for this segment (e.g., `0:30`) |
| **Narrative** | What you'll say — your voiceover script |
| **Demo Actions** | What happens on screen — clicks, navigation, typing |
| **Screenshot** | Reference image showing the expected screen state |

### Inline Editing

Click any cell to edit it directly. The table supports:
- Rich text formatting in narrative and action cells
- Drag handles on the left to reorder rows
- Add/remove rows with the toolbar buttons

### Screenshot Capture

Each row's screenshot cell has a capture button that opens the
**Screen Capture Overlay**. This lets you:

- Select from multiple monitors
- Draw a region to capture, or capture the full screen
- The captured image is stored with the sketch and displayed as a thumbnail
- Click any thumbnail to open a **lightbox** for full-size preview

## Document Lifecycle

Sketches progress through lifecycle states:

1. **Draft** — Initial planning phase, freely editable
2. **Recording Enriched** — After recording, actions are linked back to sketch rows
3. **Refined** — After AI agent processing (coming soon)
4. **Final** — Locked for production

## Versioning

Every `Ctrl+S` creates a named snapshot of the current sketch state. The
**Version History** panel (right sidebar) shows a visual timeline graph where
you can:

- Browse all saved versions
- Preview any past version without losing current work
- Restore or fork from a previous version
- See dirty/unsaved state indicators

<Aside type="tip">
  Versioning uses **gitoxide (gix)** — a pure-Rust git implementation. Your 
  project folder becomes a lightweight git repository for document history,
  completely separate from your source code git repo.
