<Aside type="caution" title="Experimental Feature">
  Browser recording is functional but has not been fully tested and validated 
  across all environments. It currently works best on **Windows** with Chrome. 
  Expect rough edges — please report issues on GitHub.
</Aside>

CutReady records browser interactions by launching Chrome or Edge via Playwright
and capturing every action you perform — clicks, typing, navigation, scrolling,
and more.

## Profile Detection

CutReady automatically detects installed browser profiles on your system:

- **Google Chrome** — Default and named profiles
- **Microsoft Edge** — Default and named profiles

Each profile includes its cookies, extensions, and login sessions, so your demo
environment is ready to go without additional setup.

<Aside type="note" title="Windows-only recording">
  Browser interaction recording currently uses Windows-specific APIs for process
  management. macOS and Linux support is planned. Screen capture works on all
  platforms.

## Recording Modes

### Free-form Recording

Start recording and perform your demo naturally. Every interaction is captured
as an **ActionCard** in real-time:

- **Navigate** — URL changes and page loads
- **Click** — Element clicks with CSS selector tracking
- **Type** — Text input with target field identification
- **Scroll** — Scroll position changes
- **Wait** — Timing gaps between actions
- **Screenshot** — Manual capture points during recording

### Step-by-step Recording

Guided by your sketch rows, the recorder pauses between each planned step. This
mode is ideal for complex demos where you want to:

- Verify each step completed correctly
- Add notes or adjust timing between steps
- Ensure the recorded sequence matches your plan exactly

## Action Stream

During recording, captured actions appear as cards in the Recording Panel:

Each **ActionCard** displays:
- **Action type** — Color-coded badge (Navigate, Click, Type, etc.)
- **Description** — Human-readable summary of what happened
- **Timestamp** — When the action occurred
- **Thumbnail** — Screenshot at the moment of the action (when available)

## Session Management

- **Start** — Launches the selected browser profile and begins capturing
- **Stop** — Ends the recording session
- **Review** — Browse all captured actions in the session
- Sessions are saved as JSON in the project's `recordings/` directory

## Browser Requirements

- **Chrome** or **Edge** must be installed
- The browser is launched with CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) for automation
- Your existing profiles and login sessions are preserved
