CutReady includes a full version history system backed by **gitoxide (gix)**,
a pure-Rust git implementation. Every save creates a snapshot that you can
browse, compare, and restore.

## How It Works

The version history lives in the **right sidebar panel** of the sketch editor.
It shows a visual **snapshot graph** — a DAG (directed acyclic graph)
visualization of your document history.

### Saving Versions

Press `Ctrl+S` to save a version:
1. A dialog appears asking for a **label** (e.g., "Added intro section")
2. The current state is committed to the project's internal git repository
3. A new node appears in the snapshot graph

### Visual Timeline

The snapshot graph displays:
- **Nodes** for each saved version, arranged chronologically
- **Edges** connecting parent-child versions
- **Branch points** where history diverged
- **Current position** highlighted in the graph
- **Dirty state indicator** when unsaved changes exist

## Restoring Versions

Click any node in the snapshot graph to preview that version. From there you can:

- **Restore** — Replace the current document with the selected version
- **Fork** — Create a new branch from the selected point
- **Stash** — Temporarily save unsaved changes before switching

<Aside type="tip">
  Restoring a version doesn't destroy history. The restore itself becomes a 
  new snapshot, so you can always go back to any previous state.
</Aside>

## Editor State Persistence

CutReady preserves your editor state across sessions:
- Scroll position
- Cursor location  
- Open tabs and active document
- Sidebar width and visibility

This state is saved separately from document content and restored when
you reopen a project.

## Technical Details

- Snapshots are stored in a `.snapshots/` directory within the project
- Each snapshot is a git commit with the document JSON as the tree content
- The graph is computed from the commit DAG using `gix`
- No external git installation required — it's all built into the app
