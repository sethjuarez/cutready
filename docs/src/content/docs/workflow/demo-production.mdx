CutReady provides a structured, multi-phase workflow for producing demo videos.
Each phase builds on the previous one, transforming rough plans into polished
video output.

## Overview

<WorkflowSteps>
  <WorkflowStep title="Sketch">
    Plan your demo structure with narrative, actions, and reference screenshots.
  </WorkflowStep>
  <WorkflowStep title="Record">
    Capture browser interactions using automated Playwright-based recording.
  </WorkflowStep>
  <WorkflowStep title="Refine">
    AI agent processes captured actions into a clean, reproducible script.
  </WorkflowStep>
  <WorkflowStep title="Produce">
    Replay the polished script while recording lossless video and audio.
  </WorkflowStep>
  <WorkflowStep title="Export">
    Package everything into FCPXML timelines for professional video editing.
  </WorkflowStep>
</WorkflowSteps>

## Phase 0: Sketch <Badge text="Available" variant="success" />

<Steps>
1. Create a new project folder
2. Add sketches with the 4-column planning table
3. Capture reference screenshots for each step
4. Organize sketches into storyboards
5. Save versions as you iterate on the plan
</Steps>

**Key features used:** Sketch Editor, Screen Capture, Storyboard Management, Version History

## Phase 1: Record <Badge text="Available" variant="success" />

<Steps>
1. Select a browser profile (Chrome or Edge)
2. Choose recording mode (free-form or step-by-step)
3. Perform your demo while CutReady captures every interaction
4. Review the captured action stream
5. Re-record individual steps if needed
</Steps>

**Key features used:** Browser Recording, Action Stream, Profile Detection

## Phase 2: Refine <Badge text="Planned" variant="caution" />

<Aside type="caution" title="Coming Soon">
  AI refinement is planned but not yet implemented. This phase will use Azure 
  OpenAI to process raw recordings into clean, reproducible scripts.
</Aside>

The AI agent will:
- Clean up redundant or accidental actions
- Stabilize CSS selectors for reliability
- Generate narration text from the demo flow
- Suggest timing adjustments and animations
- Map recorded actions back to sketch rows

## Phase 3: Review <Badge text="In Progress" variant="note" />

<Aside type="note" title="In Development">
  The script editor UI exists but is currently showing an empty state. 
  Full editing capabilities are being built.
</Aside>

The Script Editor will provide:
- Row-by-row editing of the captured/refined script
- Accept, reject, or re-record individual steps
- Modify selectors, timing, and text inputs
- Preview actions before committing changes

## Phase 4: Produce <Badge text="Planned" variant="caution" />

<Aside type="caution" title="Coming Soon">
  Video production via automated replay is planned for a future release.
</Aside>

This phase will:
- Replay the finalized action sequence in a controlled browser
- Record lossless video (FFV1 codec in MKV container) via FFmpeg
- Capture system audio and narration tracks separately
- Generate frame-accurate timing metadata

## Phase 5: Export <Badge text="Planned" variant="caution" />

<Aside type="caution" title="Coming Soon">
  FCPXML export for professional video editors is planned for a future release.
</Aside>

Export will produce:
- **FCPXML 1.9** timeline for DaVinci Resolve
- Organized output folder with video, audio, and metadata
- Multi-track support (screen recording, narration, system audio)
- Chapter markers aligned with sketch rows
