This guide walks you through creating your first CutReady project.

## Create a Project

<Steps>

1. **Launch CutReady** — You'll land on the Home screen.

2. **Click "New Project"** — Choose a folder on your filesystem. CutReady creates
   a project structure inside it with directories for sketches, storyboards,
   notes, and recordings.

3. **Name your project** — Give it a descriptive name like "Product Demo Q1".

</Steps>

## Create a Sketch

Sketches are the planning backbone of your demo. Each sketch contains a
structured table with your demo script.

<Steps>

1. **Click the Sketch icon** (✏️) in the sidebar to switch to Sketch view.

2. **Click "New Sketch"** in the storyboard list panel.

3. **Fill in the planning table** — Each row has four columns:

   | Column | Purpose |
   |--------|---------|
   | **Time** | Approximate timing for this step |
   | **Narrative** | What you'll say during this step |
   | **Demo Actions** | What happens on screen |
   | **Screenshot** | Reference image (captured or uploaded) |

4. **Add screenshots** — Click the capture button (📸) in any screenshot cell to
   take a reference screenshot directly from your screen.

5. **Save a version** — Press `Ctrl+S` to create a snapshot. CutReady uses
   git-based versioning, so you can always go back.

</Steps>

## Record a Demo

<Steps>

1. **Switch to Record view** — Click the Record icon (🔴) in the sidebar.

2. **Select a browser profile** — CutReady auto-detects Chrome and Edge profiles.
   Pick the one with your demo environment already set up.

3. **Start recording** — CutReady launches the browser and captures every click,
   keystroke, navigation, and scroll.

4. **Perform your demo** — Walk through the steps from your sketch.

5. **Stop recording** — Click the stop button. Your captured actions appear as
   cards in the recording panel.

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  Use **step-by-step mode** to pause between sketch rows — great for complex demos
  where you want to verify each step before moving on.
