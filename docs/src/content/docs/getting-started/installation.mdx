## Download

CutReady provides pre-built installers for all major platforms. Download the latest
release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/sethjuarez/cutready/releases).

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    Download the `.msi` or `.exe` (NSIS) installer from the release page.

    1. Run the installer
    2. Follow the setup wizard
    3. Launch CutReady from the Start Menu

    <Aside type="note">
      Windows builds are not yet code-signed. You may see a SmartScreen warning — 
      click "More info" → "Run anyway" to proceed.
    </Aside>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="macOS">
    Download the `.dmg` file for your architecture:
    - **Apple Silicon** (M1/M2/M3): `CutReady_x.x.x_aarch64.dmg`
    - **Intel**: `CutReady_x.x.x_x64.dmg`

    1. Open the `.dmg` file
    2. Drag CutReady to your Applications folder
    3. On first launch, right-click → Open to bypass Gatekeeper

    <Aside type="note">
      macOS builds are not yet notarized. You'll need to explicitly allow the app 
      in System Settings → Privacy & Security after the first launch attempt.
    </Aside>
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Linux">
    Download the `.deb` package or `.AppImage`:

    **Debian/Ubuntu (.deb):**
    ```bash
    sudo dpkg -i cutready_x.x.x_amd64.deb
    ```

    **AppImage:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x CutReady_x.x.x_amd64.AppImage
    ./CutReady_x.x.x_amd64.AppImage
    ```

    <Aside type="tip">
      The Linux build requires PipeWire and GBM libraries for screen capture. 
      On Ubuntu 24.04+, these are typically pre-installed.
