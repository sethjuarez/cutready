  This roadmap reflects current development plans and may change. Features 
  listed here are not yet available unless marked otherwise.
</Aside>

## Current Release (v0.1.0)

The initial release includes the foundation for demo video production:

- ✅ **Project management** — Create, open, and organize projects
- ✅ **Sketch editor** — 4-column planning tables with inline editing
- ✅ **Screen capture** — Multi-monitor screenshots with region selection
- ✅ **Storyboard management** — Drag-and-drop organization
- ✅ **Version history** — Git-backed snapshots with visual timeline
- ✅ **Markdown notes** — CodeMirror editor with auto-save
- ✅ **Browser recording** — Playwright-based interaction capture (Windows)
- ✅ **Command palette** — Keyboard-driven command access
- ✅ **Cross-platform builds** — Windows, macOS (ARM + Intel), Linux

## Upcoming: AI Refinement <Badge text="Planned" variant="caution" />

**Goal:** Automatically transform raw recordings into clean, reproducible scripts.

Planned capabilities:
- Redundant action removal (accidental clicks, navigation corrections)
- CSS selector stabilization for replay reliability
- Narration generation from demo flow
- Timing optimization and animation suggestions
- Sketch-to-recording alignment

This will use **Azure OpenAI** with configurable API endpoints (already 
supported in Settings).

## Upcoming: Script Editor <Badge text="In Progress" variant="note" />

**Goal:** Full editing interface for recorded/refined scripts.

Planned capabilities:
- Row-by-row script editing with accept/reject per step
- Re-record individual steps without restarting the full recording
- Selector modification and timing adjustment
- Action preview before committing changes
- Side-by-side view with original sketch

## Upcoming: Video Production <Badge text="Planned" variant="caution" />

**Goal:** Automated replay and lossless video capture.

Planned capabilities:
- Controlled browser replay of the finalized action sequence
- FFmpeg integration for lossless recording (FFV1 in MKV)
- Separate audio tracks (system audio, narration)
- Frame-accurate timing metadata
- Retry individual segments on failure

## Upcoming: Export & Packaging <Badge text="Planned" variant="caution" />

**Goal:** Professional video editor integration.

Planned capabilities:
- FCPXML 1.9 timeline export (DaVinci Resolve compatible)
- Organized output folders with media, metadata, and project files
- Multi-track assembly (video, narration, system audio)
- Chapter markers aligned with sketch rows
- Batch export for multiple storyboards

## Upcoming: Animation Engine <Badge text="Planned" variant="caution" />

**Goal:** Integrate motion graphics and educational animations.

Planned capabilities:
- ManimCE integration for mathematical/educational animations
- Pre-built animation library with customizable parameters
- Timeline merge for inserting animations into the video sequence
- Preview rendering before final export

## Future Considerations

- **Code signing** — macOS notarization and Windows EV certificates
- **Auto-update** — Built-in update mechanism via Tauri updater
- **Cloud sync** — Optional project synchronization
- **Team collaboration** — Shared projects and review workflows
- **Plugin system** — Extensible architecture for custom actions
