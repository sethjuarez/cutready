<Aside type="caution" title="Early Access">
  CutReady is in active development (v0.1.0). Sketch planning, browser recording, 
  screen capture, and storyboard management are functional. AI refinement, video 
  production, and export are coming soon.

## What is CutReady?

**CutReady** is a desktop application for producing demo videos. It provides a
structured workflow that takes you from initial planning sketches through automated
browser recording to polished video output — all in a single tool.

The core idea: instead of screen-recording a live demo (and hoping nothing goes
wrong), you **plan** the demo as a storyboard, **record** the interactions once,
then **replay** them perfectly every time for flawless video capture.

## Who is it for?

- **Developer advocates** creating product walkthroughs
- **Product managers** building demo reels
- **Educators** producing tutorial content
- **Anyone** who needs repeatable, polished screen recordings

## The Workflow

CutReady follows a phased approach:

| Phase | Name | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 0 | **Sketch** — Plan your demo with structured tables | <Badge text="Available" variant="success" /> |
| 1 | **Record** — Capture browser interactions | <Badge text="Available" variant="success" /> |
| 2 | **Refine** — AI cleans up and enhances | <Badge text="Planned" variant="caution" /> |
| 3 | **Review** — Edit the captured script | <Badge text="In Progress" variant="note" /> |
| 4 | **Produce** — Replay and record video | <Badge text="Planned" variant="caution" /> |
| 5 | **Export** — Package for video editors | <Badge text="Planned" variant="caution" /> |
